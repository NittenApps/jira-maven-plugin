Collection of maven goals to work with the JIRA Cloud platform, by using the
[JIRA REST API v3](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/).

This plugin is based on the [maven-changes-plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-changes-plugin/) plugin,
addressing the cloud platform authentication, and using the version 3 of the JIRA REST API.

## Usage
This project acts as a regular reporting plugin, so you only need to add it to your reporting plugins list.

```xml
<project>
  ...
    <reporting>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>dev.nittenapps.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>jira-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>${jira-maven-plugin.version}</version>
          <configuration>
            <onlyCurrentVersion>true</onlyCurrentVersion>
          </configuration>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </reporting>
  ...
</project>
```

In order to authenticate to your JIRA Cloud account this plugin uses the server configuration in the Maven settings
file, you just need to create an API Token, and supply it as the password of your JIRA account.

```xml
<settings>
  ...
    <server>
      <id>jira</id>
      <username>${jira.user}</username>
      <password>${jira.apiToken}</password>
    </server>
  ...
</settings>
```
